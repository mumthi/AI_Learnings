"""  Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent 
variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). 
Hence, the name is Linear Regression.
                                            Y=Θ1+Θ2.X
x: input training data (univariate – one input variable(parameter))
y: labels to data (supervised learning)

When training the model – it fits the best line to predict the value of y for a given value of x.
The model gets the best regression fit line by finding the best θ1 and θ2 values.
θ1: intercept
θ2: coefficient of x
